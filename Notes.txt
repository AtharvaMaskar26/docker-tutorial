# Why Docker?
- Inititlaly one application on one server 
- To scale your application you would have to buy a new server box 
- Virtual Machines Solved the problems 
- Virtual Machines allowed multiple applications per server. But VMs required their own dedicated CPUs and memory. 
- While this was much better than one server per application there was still some room for improvement.

Problems with VMs. 
- Works on my machine but not on yours 

Wouldn't it be cool to run 

#Containers 
What you do is like a container pack all your project requirements in a container and send it to anyone you want. He can now run the code without facing any issues. 

# Running Docker on Windows 
Windows requires Docker Desktop, docker running on windows host will not run on linux and vice versa

# What is Docker?
It is a container platform that allows you to build, test and deploy applications quickly. A developer defines all the applications and it's dependencies in a docker file which is then used to build docker images that defines a Docker container. Doing this ensures that your application will run in any environment. 

Runtime - Allows us to start and stop containers 
    - runc - works with OS to start and stop 
    - containerd - Managing runc & managing container related to networking and pulling images 

Engine - Used to interact with the docker, daemon
    
Orchestration - Allows us to manage containers

Docker Image - To allow someone to run my app I can just send an image of my app which he can run easily. 
Dockerfile is a set of instructions followed to run the app. 
While Image is the output formed by following the set of instructions from the dockerfile. 
Image is formed from the dockerfile.  

Open Container initative (OCI)

By default images of most popular programs like ubuntu are available online in places like dockerHub similar to github. 
For example if you want to run ubuntu you can run it's image available online. 
Eg: docker run -it ubuntu
You can run ubuntu in few seconds 

docker ps : Shows all the files running 
Here it will show the id of the instances running 

docker pull idname

docker stop idname 

docker images
